## PUD Lab - Let's Build A Chatbot in 90 Minutes

Hello and welcome to this lab on building a chat bot in 90 minutes. In this
session we will go over the different types of chat bots, see real-world 
example of chat-driven NetDevOps and even implement some natural language 
understanding.

## Requirements

* A [Webex Teams](teams.webex.com) account.
* A tunnel solution. We recommend [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)

## Setup

This setup should be run before the event. You will need python version3 installed. You can find a handy guide on how to setup python for different operating systems [here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).

Next, we will need to install the requirements. To do so, navigate to this folder in 
your command line and run: 

On Mac OS X/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On Windows:

```
py3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it :) You are ready for the lab! If you have any questions please don't hesitate
to reach out to me via E-Mail or Webex Teams on mneiding@cisco.com
